                    <p>Sri Lankan tea (known for generations as Ceylon Tea) carries behind it a heritage and success
                        story like no other. A product that began as a diversification experiment in 1867 spanning just
                        19 acres of
                        land has today surpassed all geographical borders to satisfy 19% of global demand.<br><br>
                        Reputed for its
                        signature taste and aroma, Sri Lanka has become the <b>world's third largest tea exporter to the
                            world, </b> the country's
                        largest employer and has the distinction of supplying tea to the Olympic and Commonwealth Games.
                        It is a
                        great equalizer, demanding attention from the counter of the smallest eatery to the most
                        exclusive

                        standards. The tea processing factories for exports continually improve and upgrade to meet

                    <p> Sri Lanka was introduced to tea much later. Until the 1860’s the main crop produced in Sri Lanka
                        was Coffee but in 1869 a fungus destroyed the crop so the estate owners had to diversify into
                        other crops. Firstly a tea plant was brought to Sri Lanka from China and was planted in the
                        Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya, this was planted for non-commercial purposes. In 1867 James
                        Taylor planted 19 acres of tea in the Loolecondera estate in Kandy, and there in on tea became a
                        commercially used crop in Sri Lanka. In 1872, James Taylor started a fully equipped tea factory
                        in the same estate and in the same year he made the first sale of tea in Kandy. In 1873 the
                        first international sale of tea was made, a shipment consisting of 23lb’s of tea was sent to an
                        auction in London.</p><br><br>
                    <p>The production of tea rose rapidly in 1880’s and by 1899 the area cultivated had exceedingly
                        grown to nearly 400,000 acres of tea. By that time British figures such as Henry Randolph
                        Trafford arrived in Sri Lanka and purchased coffee estates, his knowledge about coffee was
                        limited but his knowledge about to tea was vast and he is now considered on of the pioneers in
                        tea plantation in Sri Lanka</p><br><br>
                    <p>The rapid growth and popularity of tea, lead to it being sold at several auctions. The first
                        public auction of tea was held at Somerville & Co in July 1883. and then went on to being sold
                        at auctions held worldwide, a total sum of one million tea packets were sold in the Chicago
                        World Fair in 1893. The Ceylon Tea Traders association was formed in 1894 and today all tea
                        produced in Sri Lanka is conducted by this association along with the Ceylon Chamber of
                        Commerce. Later in 1896 the Colombo Broker’s Association was formed and in 1915 the first
                        Ceylonese was appointed as the Chairman of the Planter’s Association, his name was Thomas
                        Amarasuriya. By 1927 the production if tea in the country exceeded 100,00o metric tonnes which
                        was almost entirely for export purposes</p><br><br>
                    <p>By the 1960’s the total production of tea and exports exceeded to 200,000 metric tones and
                        200,000 hectares, and for the first time in 1965, Sri Lanka became the world’s largest tea
                        exporter. In 1963 the production and export of instant Tea was introduced and the first
                        International Tea Convention was held in 1966 to commemorate 100 years of tea industry in Sri
                        Lanka. In 1976 the Sri Lankan Tea Board was founded along with others such as the Janatha Estate
                        Development Board, Sri Lanka Estate Plantation Cooperation and the Tea Small Holding Development
                        Authority, these bodies played a major part when it came to supervising the estates acquired by
                        the state. And this same year tea bags were introduced to export.</p><br><br>
                    <p>In 1980 the official supplier of tea for the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympic Games was Sri Lanka, and
                        again in 1982 for the 12th Commonwealth Games held Brisbane and alter on in 1987 at the Expo 88
                        in Australia.</p><br><br>
                    <p> Subsequently in the years to come the production and the export of tea rapidly increased and was
                        introduced to variations, such as the production of Green Tea and also other flavored tea. In
                        2001 tea made it’s first online sale at the Colombo Tea auctions.
                        Ceylon Tea is famous worldwide, the weather conditions in the country provides vastly to the
                        success of its growth and is made famous by the taste and quality that is only unique to Ceylon
                        Tea. Sri Lanka caters Ceylon Tea to a number of global markets and has become the most favorite
                        beverage among its consumers worldwide.

                    and dedication
                    that goes into producing Ceylon Tea is what makes it extra special. Sri Lanka is home to over
                    188,000 hectares of land under tea cultivation which yields about 298,000 tonnes of produced tea and
                    it accounts for more than 19% of world exports.<br><br> Ceylon Tea that is being exported around the
                    world
                    comes in several types, the most commonly and famously enjoyed is of course Ceylon Black tea,
                    secondly Green tea and lastly White Tea or ‘ Silver Tips’. These teas are produced in different ways
                    to achieve it’s quality and taste.

                        <p> Ceylon Black tea is the
                            most oxidized variety and contains more caffeine than the rest of the varieties. Black tea
                            is
                            best grown in a climate that is hot and moist. As a result of being close to the
                            equator the climatic conditions of Sri Lanka is ideal to grow and produce Black tea. Tea is
                            grown in numerous estates around the country which vary in altitude thus giving it
                            distinctive
                            qualities. High grown tea has a honey golden liquor that is light and considered to be one
                            of
                            the best tasting teas around the world due to its well-defined flavor, aroma and strength.
                            Low
                            grown tea has a burgundy brown liquor and a flavor which is rather strong. Mid grown teas
                            have a
                            strong, rich and full-bodied flavor.</p>

                        <p> Like black tea, tea lovers around the world are in the process of discovering the joys of
                            green
                            tea. The
                            Ceylon Green Tea industry, though very young, is growing rapidly as the product has garnered
                            a
                            popularity among tea drinkers around the world. Ceylon Green tea has a
                            fuller body with a rather pungent and malty, nutty flavor to it. Today Ceylon Green Tea is
                            manufactured in a number of estates in mid-grown and high-grown districts. Ceylon Green teas
                            have characteristics that differentiate them
                            from the rest of the green teas produced around the world, they tend to be darker in both
                            dry
                            and infused leaf and contains a rather rich flavor.</p>

                        <p>Ceylon white is also produced from the same plant as the black and green tea, though the
                            plant
                            has slight differences to it. The leaves and buds are left to wither in natural sunlight and
                            there after they are lightly processed to avoid oxidization, this results in white tea being
                            the
                            least processed tea of all and is abundant with health benefits. Ceylon white is is famously
                            known as ‘Silver Tips’, this is due to the color it transforms into after the manufacturing
                            process, it is also one of the most priced teas in Sri Lanka. Ceylon White tea is famous
                            among
                            tea lovers for its mild and sweet flavor, it has
                            a delicate, very light liquoring with notes of pine and honey and a golden coppery infusion.
